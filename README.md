# Python Developer Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains the solutions for the Python Developer Assignment, which tests Python fundamentals, problem-solving, and code readability. The assignment is divided into two parts:
- **Part 1**: Five coding challenges covering string manipulation, file handling, object-oriented programming, and algorithmic problems (Two Sum and Group Anagrams).
- **Part 2**: A console-based To-Do List Manager mini-project with persistent storage in a JSON file.

All code is written in **Python 3.8+** using only standard libraries, adhering to the **PEP 8** style guide for clean and readable code. The solutions are implemented in Jupyter Notebook files (`Part 1.ipynb` and `Part2.ipynb`) for easy execution and testing.

## Repository Structure
- `Part 1.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing solutions for the five coding challenges (Q1–Q5).
- `Part2.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the To-Do List Manager mini-project.
- `students.txt`: Sample input file for Q2 (File Handling), containing student names and marks.
- `README.md`: This file, providing instructions and project details.
- `tasks.json`: Auto-generated by the To-Do List Manager (Part 2) to store tasks (created when tasks are added).

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**: Ensure Python is installed (`python --version` to check).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Required to run the `.ipynb` files.
  - Install via: `pip install notebook`
- No external packages are required; only standard Python libraries (`json`, `os`, `string`) are used.

## How to Run
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-github-repo-link>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```
   Replace `<your-github-repo-link>` with the actual GitHub repository URL.

2. **Set Up the Environment**:
   - Ensure `students.txt` is in the same directory as `Part 1.ipynb` for Q2 (File Handling).
   - Sample `students.txt` content:
     ```
     Alice, 85
     Bob, 67
     Charlie, 92
     David, 74
     Eva, 90
     ```

3. **Run Part 1 (Coding Challenges)**:
   - Open `Part 1.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook Part 1.ipynb
     ```
   - Execute all cells to run the solutions for:
     - **Q1**: String & List Manipulation (returns word count, longest word, unique words).
     - **Q2**: File Handling (reads `students.txt`, outputs top 3 students and average marks).
     - **Q3**: OOP – Bank Account (demonstrates account creation and transactions).
     - **Q4**: Two Sum (finds indices of numbers summing to a target).
     - **Q5**: Group Anagrams (groups anagram strings).
   - Expected outputs are included in the notebook cells.

4. **Run Part 2 (To-Do List Manager)**:
   - Open `Part2.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook Part2.ipynb
     ```
   - Execute all cells to start the console-based To-Do List Manager.
   - Follow the menu prompts to:
     - Add a task (e.g., "Buy groceries").
     - View all tasks (shows ID, description, and status: Completed/Pending).
     - Mark a task as completed by ID.
     - Delete a task by ID.
     - Exit the program.
   - Tasks are saved to `tasks.json` for persistence.

5. **Sample Interaction (Part 2)**:
   ```
   To-Do List Manager
   ------------------
   1. Add Task
   2. View Tasks
   3. Complete Task
   4. Delete Task
   5. Exit
   ------------------
   Enter your choice: 1
   Enter task description: Buy groceries
   Task 'Buy groceries' added with ID 1
   ```

## Notes
- **Code Style**: All code follows PEP 8 guidelines for readability and consistency.
- **File Handling**:
  - Q2 requires `students.txt` to exist in the same directory as `Part 1.ipynb`.
  - Part 2 creates `tasks.json` automatically when tasks are added.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Q2 handles file-not-found errors and invalid marks.
  - Part 2 validates task descriptions (non-empty) and task IDs (numeric).
- **Testing**:
  - Part 1 includes test cases for each question, covering edge cases (e.g., empty inputs, duplicates).
  - Part 2 supports interactive testing via the console menu.
- **Assumptions**:
  - Q2 assumes `students.txt` has the format `name, marks` per line.
  - Q4 and Q5 assume valid inputs as per problem constraints (e.g., one solution for Two Sum).

## Troubleshooting
- **File Not Found**: Ensure `students.txt` is in the same directory as `Part 1.ipynb`.
- **Jupyter Issues**: Install Jupyter with `pip install notebook` and run `jupyter notebook`.
- **Python Version**: Use Python 3.8+ (`python --version` to verify).
- **Errors**: If you encounter errors, check the console output or notebook cell errors for details.
